# Handwriting Synthesis Dataset Enhancement Notes

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the handwriting synthesis dataset to improve number and symbol generation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Enhanced Dataset (156 Samples)
- **Previous Issue**: Original model was trained on IAM dataset which had poor number representation
- **Solution**: Created 156 new handwriting samples specifically including:
  - Numbers 0-9 throughout the samples
  - @ symbols (for email addresses)
  - Various punctuation marks (. , - _ /)
  - Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters

### 2. Dataset Processing
- Converted handwriting stroke data from XML format to numpy arrays
- Created alphabet file with 52 unique characters including digits and symbols
- Processed data into required format:
  - `x.npy`: Stroke coordinates (156, 5000, 3)
  - `c.npy`: Encoded text (156, 75)
  - `x_len.npy`: Stroke lengths (156,)
  - `c_len.npy`: Text lengths (156,)
  - `alphabet.npy`: Character set (52,)

### 3. Key Improvements
- **Increased Stroke Detail**: Updated from 1200 to 5000 points per sequence
- **Better Number Coverage**: Every digit 0-9 is well represented
- **Symbol Support**: Added @ symbol and common punctuation
- **Consistent Quality**: All samples are from the same handwriting style

## Current Status
- ✅ 156 enhanced samples ready for training
- ✅ All data in correct format in `data/processed/`
- ✅ Backup of data in `data/backup_user_data/`
- ❌ Not merged with original IAM dataset (original has ~5,760 samples but poor numbers)

## Training Instructions
1. Clone/pull the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run training: `python rnn.py`

## Why Not Merged?
We attempted to merge with the original IAM dataset but:
- The original IAM data structure was incomplete
- Original dataset had poor number representation anyway
- Our 156 focused samples may train better for number/symbol generation

## Expected Improvements
The model trained on this dataset should:
- Generate much better numbers (0-9)
- Properly handle @ symbols and email addresses
- Have smoother, more detailed strokes due to 5000-point sequences
- Maintain good letter generation quality

## Dataset Sample Examples
- Phone numbers: "67890020201", "89721345621"
- Email addresses: "816christos@gmail.com"
- Mixed text: "Hello world this is a test"
- Technical terms: "Machine learning is fascinating"

## Notes for Future Improvements
1. Could potentially merge with original IAM dataset if proper preprocessing is set up
2. May benefit from data augmentation techniques
3. Consider adding more special characters if needed
4. Current 156 samples might be expanded with more diverse handwriting styles
